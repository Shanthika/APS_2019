GENERATING BIONOMIAL CO-EFFICIENTS:

Approach 1: Generate a dynamic 2D matrics of size (n*k).
-Space occupied would be (n*k)

Approach 2: Use of recursion with n,k as input to function
-Space occupied would be (2^k)
-Preferable if the code requires only one or two queries of bionomial coefficient.
-For repeated queries, maintaining a table would be more efficient.

Approach 3: Maintaing a 1D array of coefficients.
-Space occupied would be (k+1).
-Computationally inexpensive compared to recursion,also does not save unnecessary values.
-Most suitable in case of one or two queries.
